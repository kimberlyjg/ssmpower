Description: Provides power analysis and sample size planning tools for 
    Structural Summary Method (SSM) analyses of circumplex data. Implements
    closed-form power functions for amplitude and elevation parameters based
    on Zimmermann and Wright (2017) <doi:10.1177/1073191116656437>. Includes
    functions for single-sample tests, two-group comparisons, confidence 
    intervals, effect size benchmarks, and comprehensive SSM analysis with
    bootstrap confidence intervals.
