Description: Provides functions for power analysis and sample size planning 
    for Structural Summary Method (SSM) analyses of circumplex data. Includes 
    power functions for amplitude (Study 1) and angular displacement (Study 2), 
    based on empirical validation across multiple circumplex measures. Methods 
    are based on Zimmermann & Wright (2017) <doi:10.1177/1073191116656441> and 
    Gurtman (1992) <doi:10.1037/0022-3514.63.1.105>. Includes functions for 
    calculating power, determining required sample sizes, computing confidence 
    intervals, and performing bootstrap-based SSM analyses.
